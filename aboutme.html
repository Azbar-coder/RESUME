    <h2>Hello Everyone: </h2>
    <p>This is my first experience with html project and I'm trying to get in depth with these kinds of tech stacks.I love to code and I had done front end web development earlier but I want to start from scratch to have a good command in all of the tech stacks which are building blocks for webpages.</p>
    <p>As I step up in tech stacks like CSS ,JS I will try to make my resume more user friendly. <br><br>
        !!Thankyou for reading this!!
